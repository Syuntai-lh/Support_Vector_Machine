# Support_Vector_Machine
This is a naive implementation of a Support Vector Machine, which is a supervised learning based linear classifier used to classify datapoints to their distinct categories based on their labels. The implementation is done in MATLAB, using the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm which was trained using labeled datapoints.
